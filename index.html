        This is the home page for Kobe Bryant. Most people can argue that Kobe Bryant was one of 
        the best basketball players of all time. He was an American professional basketball player.
         Come with me on this journey as we look at his impact both on and off the hardwood. 
         For 20 years, he was a great NBA player for the well-known across the globe, Los Angeles 
         Lakers. Named one of the best players to ever wear the purple and gold of all time. 
         Bryant was challenged, competitive, and worked hard, which is how he got the name "Black 
         Mamba." Selected to 18 NBA All-Star games and winning five NBA titles. He also won many 
         other awards, including two NBA Finals Most Valuable Player awards and the NBA MVP award 
         in 2008. Bryant had an effect that went beyond what he did. He motivated a whole 
         generation of players with his constant desire to do the best and his "Mamba Mentality," 
         which means always getting better and being strong. He changed the sport and its culture 
         in a big way that will last for a long time.
