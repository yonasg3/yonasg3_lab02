        The honors and awards Kobe Bryant won outside of basketball were just as amazing. 
        In many ways, they showed how dedicated and skilled he is. He won an Oscar for the 
        short animated movie <em>"Dear Basketball,"</em> which was a love letter to basketball. Bryant 
        was also great at running a business. A lot of people really liked his book <em>"The Mamba 
        Mentality: How I Play."</em> He also started Kobe Inc. and Granity Studios. Another great thing 
        he did for charity was start the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation. This group 
        helped kids and families in need. Kobe caused a lot of changes. This shows that his drive 
        and desire to be the best weren't just on the basketball court. They were a big part of who
         he was and what he left behind.
